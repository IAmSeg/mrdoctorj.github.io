See below for details:\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li>\r\n              The first is a recovery service. This means that we log onto your account and play for you. This is the cheapest\r\n              option because it is easiest for us. We will work with you on times for us to play so that we do not interfere with your schedule.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              The second option is a carry service. This means you play on your own account and we play with you, \"carrying\" you to completion of the service. This option\r\n              costs a little more because it is more difficult. However, the value you get out of this option cannot be overstated. There are many benefits to opting for a carry service rather \r\n              than a recovery service. \r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>You play on your account the entire time, meaning you truly earned your reward yourself and can say that with honesty.</li>\r\n                <li>Our players are some of the best in the game and are also extremely friendly. They will guide you along the way and offer valuable game knowledge to improve your own gameplay.\r\n                They will never talk down to you or blame anything on you.</li> \r\n                <li>They will teach you game sense, top tier strategies, and ways to improve your own K/D, while also offering advice on loadouts and classes to use for your best gameplay.</li>\r\n                <li>You will get to see how top tier players work in real time competitive games.</li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  Keep in mind that if you do choose the carry service, it is always possible you will lose a few games. This is not the end of the world. Carrying is difficult and you can be unlucky if you match very good players. \r\n                  However, if you pay for the service at the agreed upon price, we guarantee your service will be completed no matter how long it takes. Our boosters have over 90% win rates in the Competitive playlist, but anything can happen.\r\n                </li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"qAndA\">\r\n        <div className=\"question\" style={questionStyle}>How can I trust you with my account?</div>\r\n        <div className=\"answer\">\r\n          At Destiny Pinnacle Services, we only employ a select few indivduals who we personally know and trust. Everyone who is a \"booster\" here is someone we have personally known for a good amount of time.\r\n          Unlike at other sites, where they try to hire as many people as possible to churn out as many orders as possible, we take the opposite approach. We keep our team small and work hard to complete orders\r\n          with the mindset of \"Quality Over Quantity\". I would personally trust my own account with any of the people on our team.\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"qAndA\">\r\n        <div className=\"question\" style={questionStyle}>Why should I choose DPS over another recov site?</div>\r\n        <div className=\"answer\">\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Like I said above, we only employ people who we know and trust, and who are friendly. Other sites will employ anyone with good stats or a big following on Twitch. I have personally played against and watched Twitch streamers doing recovs\r\n              and people doing recovs that work for other sites who will T-bag, emote, and even whisper people in game <strong>while on your account</strong> and talk shit to them and be toxic. They have even said things that could get your account banned. Our team is never toxic, will never bag or emote or message\r\n              anyone while we are logged onto your account. The other sites don't care about your account, they care about your money. At DPS we will never do anything that could harm your account, your standing with Blizzard/Bungie/Steam or even make other players dislike you.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <strong>All of our prices are negotiable.</strong> If you think our prices are not fair, contact us anyway and we will work with you. We truly enjoy helping people achieve something that would be very difficult for them to achieve on their own. That's also why we enjoy the carry\r\n              service option so much.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>When ordering with DPS, you will speak to a real person via Discord soon after you place your order. Other sites will have you place an order and send your login details via email and you never actually talk to a real person. \r\n              We will work with you and update you along the way with our progress.</li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Your account is secure with us. We will <strong>never</strong> have you send us your login details over email. Email is extremely insecure and any site that asks you to do this (most of the other sites) should not be trusted. Your account details could be stolen by anyone\r\n              with a little technical ability. We will only get your login details through a private message with only 2 parties involved (you and one of our boosters). The other sites will pass your password around between all of their boosters and it could easily be stolen or given to someone with malicious intent.\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"qAndA\">\r\n        <div className=\"question\" style={questionStyle}>How will I pay for an order?</div>\r\n        <div className=\"answer\">\r\n          Once you place an order, you will be contacted by a DPS rep with a few hours (depending on how busy we are). You will speak to each other over Discord in a private message and work out any details about the service. Once both sides agree on all the details, you will use PayPal to pay our official DPS account. \r\n          Once we have received payment, the DPS rep has the green light to proceed with your order. You will <strong>always</strong> be able to directly contact the person who is taking care of your order in case you have any questions, and they will provide progress updates along the way.\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"qAndA\">\r\n        <div className=\"question\" style={questionStyle}>Will you carry me for a shoutout and exposure?</div>\r\n        <div className=\"answer\">\r\n          Unfortunately shoutouts, exposure and Instagram followers do not pay the bills, so <strong>no, we will not carry you for a shoutout</strong>.\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"qAndA\">\r\n        <div className=\"question\" style={questionStyle}>How good are your boosters?</div>\r\n        <div className=\"answer\">\r\n          Our boosters are in the top 0.5% of Destiny players for K/D and kills per game. They routinely finish each season with Diamond ELO in all playlists. They have all obtained each pinnacle weapon (including Redrix and Not Forgotten) to date legitamately. No win trading, no cheesing on Asia servers, just good ole fashioned winning. \r\n          They are all easily capable of soloing the competitive playlist to 2100 Glory rank and have carried many friends and clanmates to Fabled rank as well (even players with less than 0.5 K/D ratios).\r\n          One of our boosters was a Crucible Sherpa who would coach people in game 1 on 1 while also performing carry services.\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"qAndA\"> \r\n        <div className=\"question\" style={questionStyle}>What platforms do you offer services on?</div>\r\n        <div className=\"answer\">\r\n          Currently we only offer services on PC. If the interest is large enough we may extend our services to console. Please <a href=\"/contact\">contact us</a> and let us know you want a service on a console and we may be able to hook you up with a trusted booster.\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"qAndA\"> \r\n        <div className=\"question\" style={questionStyle}>Why don't you offer a service for X weapon?</div>\r\n        <div className=\"answer\">\r\n          If we don't have exactly what you're looking for, <a href=\"/contact\">contact us anyway</a>. We specialize in PvP but can work with you on anything you need recovered in the game. If I can't do it myself, I know someone who can.\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Container>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Faq;\r\n\r\nFaq.propTypes = {\r\n  data: PropTypes.shape({\r\n    allMarkdownRemark: PropTypes.shape({\r\n      edges: PropTypes.arrayOf(\r\n        PropTypes.shape({\r\n          node: PropTypes.shape({\r\n            excerpt: PropTypes.string,\r\n            frontmatter: PropTypes.shape({\r\n              cover: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\r\n              path: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\r\n              title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\r\n              price: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\r\n              sortOrder: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\r\n              tags: PropTypes.array,\r\n            }),\r\n          }),\r\n        }).isRequired\r\n      ),\r\n    }),\r\n  }),\r\n};\r\n\r\nContainer.propTypes = {\r\n  center: PropTypes.object,\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const query = graphql`\r\n  query {\r\n    allMarkdownRemark(sort: { order: ASC, fields: [frontmatter___sortOrder] }) {\r\n      edges {\r\n        node {\r\n          id\r\n          excerpt(pruneLength: 200)\r\n          frontmatter {\r\n            title\r\n            path\r\n            tags\r\n            price\r\n            sortOrder\r\n            cover {\r\n              childImageSharp {\r\n                fluid(\r\n                  maxWidth: 1000\r\n                  quality: 90\r\n                  traceSVG: { color: \"#2B2B2F\" }\r\n                ) {\r\n                  ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid_withWebp_tracedSVG\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
